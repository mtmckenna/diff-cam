This program, written in Java/Processing, takes in video from a camera and only displays the differences between successive frames.  The result is a psychedelic-ish video.

Here is an example of the video output: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR7VPgh-YHg

Note:
I've only tested this program with the internal iSight camera on a MacBook Pro, but it should work with any default camera, be it internal or USB.
